Predicting the shape (circle, star, square, triangle) from an image.

Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/smeschke/four-shapes

Note: The dataset contains copious number of images, I used less than 2000 images (around 500 each) to train and was able to achieve accuracy.
I did this so that I don't have to wait a long time to train my model.
